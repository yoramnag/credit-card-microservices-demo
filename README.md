# Credit Card Microservices Demo Project Guide

## System Requirements

1.  **Docker Desktop**: Required to run Docker containers.

2.  **Postman**: For testing the APIs by importing and running
    collections.

## Steps to Run the Project

1.  **Download the Project:**

-   Clone the project from GitHub using this link:

> [**https://github.com/yoramnag/credit-card-microservices-demo.git**](https://github.com/yoramnag/credit-card-microservices-demo.git)

2.  **Set Up Docker:**

-   Open **Docker Desktop** and ensure the Docker engine is running.

3.  **Navigate to Project Folder:**

-   Open **PowerShell** or **IntelliJ IDEA** and navigate to the folder
    where the docker-compose.yml file is located.

-   You can use the following PowerShell command to change the
    directory:

> cd path\\to\\your\\project

4.  **Start Docker Containers:**

-   In the project folder, run the following command to start the Docker
    containers:

> docker compose up -d

-   After the command executes successfully, go to **Docker Desktop**
    and verify that the necessary containers are running.

## Testing the APIs with Postman

1.  **Import the Postman Collection:**

-   Open **Postman**.

-   Go to **File \> Import**, then select the credit card microservices
    demo.postman_collection.json file from your project directory. This
    file contains all the API requests required to interact with your
    services.

2.  **Run the Save Transaction Request:**

-   In Postman, locate the request named
    **transactions-service-saveTransaction-NoAuth** from the imported
    collection.

-   Run the request. You will receive a **401 Unauthorized** response.
    This is expected.

3.  **Run the Request with Authorization:**

-   Now, try to run the request named
    **transactions-service-saveTransaction-cc**. This request includes
    **OAuth 2.0 authorization**.

-   You will again receive a **401 Unauthorized** response because the
    client-id creditCard-callcenter-cc doesn't exist in Keycloak.

## Set Up Client in Keycloak

1.  **Access Keycloak Admin Console:**

Go to: <http://localhost:7080/admin/master/console/#/master/clients>

Login with the following credentials:

> **Username**: admin
>
> **Password**: admin

2.  **Create a New Client:**

-   In the **left sidebar**, select **Clients** and then click on
    **Create Client**.

-   Enter creditCard-callcenter-cc as the **Client ID** and click
    **Next**.

-   Enable **Client Authentication** and check only **Service Accounts
    Roles**.

-   **Click Next.**

3.  **Generate Client Credentials:**

-   Click on **Credentials**.

-   **Copy the Client Secret** and save it.

4.  **Update Postman with the Client Secret:**

-   Go back to Postman.

-   In the **transactions-service-saveTransaction-cc** request, update
    the **Authorization** header with the **client secret** you just
    copied.

## Obtain Access Token in Postman

1.  **Get New Access Token:**

-   In Postman, click **Get New Access Token**.

-   Once the token is generated, click **Use Token**.

2.  **Run the Request Again:**

-   Try running the transactions-service-saveTransaction-cc request
    again. You should receive a **403 Forbidden** response.

## Assign Roles to Client in Keycloak

1.  **Create New Roles in Keycloak:**

-   In Keycloak, click **Realm Roles** in the left sidebar.

-   Click **Create Role** and create the following roles (uppercase
    required):

> TRANSACTIONS
>
> BLACK-LIST
>
> 2\. **Assign Roles to the Client:**

-   In the left sidebar, click **Clients**, and select the
    creditCard-callcenter-cc client.

-   Go to **Service Account Roles** and click **Assign Role**.

-   Assign both the **TRANSACTIONS** and **BLACK-LIST** roles.

3.  **Reattempt to Get Access Token:**

-   In Postman, click on **Get New Access Token**.

-   Click **Use Token**.

4.  **Run the Request Again:**

-   Now, you should receive a **201 Created** response, indicating that
    the transaction was successfully saved.

## Grafana

1.  **Open the Application:**

-   Open your browser and go to: <http://localhost:3000/>

-   Once the page loads, navigate to the **Explore** section and select
    **Loki** to explore the logs generated by the services running in
    the Docker containers.

2.  **Set up Tempo**

<!-- -->

1.  **Access Logs:**

-   Open one of the logs generated by the application.

-   Copy the **traceID** from the log entry.

2.  **Search in Tempo:**

-   Navigate to **Tempo**

-   In Tempo\'s search bar, **paste the traceID** you copied. This will
    allow you to trace the request across various microservices
    involved.

3.  **View Trace Details:**

-   Once the traceID is entered, Tempo will display a detailed trace
    showing the microservices that participated in the request, allowing
    you to track its flow across the system.

4.  **Access Tempo from Loki:**

-   Tempo can also be accessed directly from **Loki**.

-   While viewing a log in Loki, look for the **Tempo button** (usually
    located next to the log entry).

-   Click on the **Tempo button** to automatically open the trace
    associated with that request and view the trace details.

5.  Set Up Prometheus Dashboard:

-   In Grafana, go to **Dashboards** and click **New \> Import**.

-   Use the following link to import the **JVM Micrometer** dashboard:

> <https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/4701-jvm-micrometer/>

-   Select **Prometheus** as the data source.
